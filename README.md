## Assignment Scope and Requirements 

### Using whichever open source software that you feel comfortable with (Python, R, etc.), please complete the following assignment. 
 
1.	 Please complete a web scraping of at least 100 “data analyst” job posts. Postings may come from LinkedIn, Indeed and/or Monster. Please save your results and store them in a .csv file.  

2.	Please clean and process the job posts and create a document-term matrix and use text mining to identify what you believe to be “key” or “critical” skills for this occupation. 

3.	Please explain which classification or clustering algorithms you feel are best used in order to extract “key” or “critical” skills from those job posts.

BONUS: Please write a short synopsis of what implications you feel the ability to identify in-demand skills across occupations may produce for the workforce and economy (i.e. help displaced workers find new career opportunities, help academic institutions prepare relevant programs, etc.).
